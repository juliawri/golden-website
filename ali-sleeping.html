        <img src = "./images/sleeping-ali.jpg" width="400" alt="Ali in a bed with white covers over part of him yawning">
        <p>Because Ali spends all day rompng around, he also becomes very tired at the end of the day, and in
            the middle of the day too sometimes! He can often be found in fetus position or stretched out on his stomach.
            You may not want to disturb him in his sleep though, because Ali can often get grumpy if you wake him up! </p>
