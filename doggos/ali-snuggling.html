        <p> Ali absolutely loves to snuggle up to his hoomans when he's tired, stressed out, or just needs a nap.
            Even though Ali snuggles for his own benefit, often he cheers you up too. However, Ali absoultely hates screens
            so if you ever cuddle with him make sure to put your phone away. </p>
